# 📚 LDA Topic Modeling - PIBIC  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for **topic modeling** in the context of a **PIBIC research project**. The goal is to extract hidden topics from a text dataset, providing insights into the underlying structure of the content.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization  
- **LDA Modeling**: Training an LDA model to discover latent topics  
- **Visualization**: Using word clouds and interactive topic visualizations  

## 🛠 Installation  
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Then, install the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn gensim pyLDAvis
